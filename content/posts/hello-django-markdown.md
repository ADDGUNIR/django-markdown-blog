Welcome to **Django for beginners**! This project reads Markdown posts with a YAML header
(front-matter) and renders them via Django templates.

- No ORM, no models.
- Files live under `content/posts/*.md`.
- Static images are served from `/static/img/`.

You can edit this post and refresh the page to see changes instantly during development.
